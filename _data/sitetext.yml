        desc: "Automating redundant and repetitive tasks allows you to put your time and effort into those that leverage your full thinking power and intuition. Perform routine analysis for planning and land development, public works utilities, dashboarding, and reporting. Extract, transform, and load data to and from other agencies and organizations on a predefined scheduleâ€”even when you're not at work."

Integrating business applications opens up possibilities like real-time geographic visualization of your business data, live dashboards and much more."

        desc: "Many systems are compatible with GIS or allow for integration. However, these systems don't talk to each other *out of the box*. I combine Geographic Information Systems experience with software development know-how to identify how to get from point A to point B. This also involves Geodatabase design, database ETL, GIS workflow optimization, ArcGIS Desktop Custom Add-ins, and good old-fashioned troubleshooting."
