Perform routine analysis for planning, building, public works utilities, dashboarding, and reporting. Extract, transform, import and export data to and from your business formats."

        desc: "Organizations frequently add the same information into more than one system to enable reporting and dashboarding. Integration eliminates the need for duplicate and repetetive data entry. It also enables more complete analysis, reporting and budgeting, Asset management operations, dashboarding and visualization. Additionally, it allows real-time geographic visualization of 3rd-party system information."

        desc: "Many systems are compatible with GIS or allow for integration. However, these systems don't talk to each other *out of the box*. I combine Geographic Information Systems experience with software development know-how for seamless system linkages worthy of high-fives. This also involves Geodatabase design and build, GIS workflow optimization, ArcGIS Desktop Custom Add-ins, and good old-fashioned troubleshooting."

Idea sharing and continued **brainstorming along the way** has always led to something **better than we originally imagined.**"
