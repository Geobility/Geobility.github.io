In 2017, [a good friend](https://boisetrailschallenge.com/about) asked me if I knew how to set up a website where anyone who wanted to ride all the trails in the foothills could submit their GPS file and have it mark off their progress. I couldn't have accomplished it all myself. But with the help of a friend web developer and a great team, we were able to create a local trail community event that has been a real joy to be a part of. Integrations with Strava and some SQL Server Geometry *magic* came together to host over 11,000 participants giving it all they had to watch the trails turn green on their map as they completed them.
