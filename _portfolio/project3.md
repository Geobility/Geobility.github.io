As the City of Meridian grew from a small city of 65K to reach the threshold of 100K, their needs and uses of geographic data changed drastically. The city transitioned from internal use only,  with a single Enterprise Geodatabase, to separate editing and publishing environments for internal staff.  It also increased the level of service dramatically for the general public, enabling the public to access maps and information previously only available to internal staff. This reduced the demand on planning and land development staff. It also increases transparency. These improvements were realized through:  
<ul style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
  <li>Enterprise Geodatabase Design, Implementation, and Maintenance in SQL Server</li>
  <li>ArcGIS Enterprise Portal and Server Installation and Administration</li>
  <li>Workflow/Dataflow Process Design and Improvement</li>
</ul> 

Is your GIS environment keeping up with growth?
