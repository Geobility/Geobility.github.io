As the City of Meridian grew from a small city of 65K to reach that threshold of 100K, their needs and uses of geographic data and changed drastically. Transitioning the city from internal use only with a single Enterprise Geodatabase to separate editing and publishing environments for internal staff as well as the general public has increased the level of service dramatically. Enabling the public to access maps and information previously only available to internal staff reduced the demand on planning and land development staffs time. It also increases transparency. These improvements were realized through:  
Enterprise Geodatabase Design, Implementation, and Maintenance in SQL Server  
ArcGIS Enterprise Portal and Server Installation and Administration  
Workflow/Dataflow Process Design and Improvement  

Is your GIS environment keeping up with growth?
