The City of Meridian is one of those hardest-hit by the rapid population growth that began around 2006. With a firm strategic goal of a balanced budget and never operating in the red, they did not want to meet the increased demand by hiring more staff that would eventually have to be let go when the population growth levelled off. This required a great deal of innovation, looking to improve processes to gain efficiency and run lean. Automation has allowed GIS staff to accomplish more with only a couple additions to the GIS staffâ€”only two positions added since 2007. The city consumes GIS data from Ada County, COMPASS, Canyon County and the City of Boise and shares their data with those and others. Hands-on workflows could accomplish this work but were prone to inconsistencies in the data and the schedule (don't you want a vacation just reading this?). Additionally, documentation was slim on each individual process, making continuity very difficult. In-line documentation within scrips provides a step-by-step guide of what the process is doing in case someone needed to do it by hand. Through python scripting, MS SQL Server Programming, and C# Console apps, other agencies can depend on data being delivered on a consistent schedule and in a standard format. This, in turn, allows other agencies to automate on their end as well, providing efficiencies throughout the valley.

### Ada County Address Compilation
Addresses are added or changed daily. Thanks to automation, they are also compiled daily. The Cities of Meridian and Boise as well as others managed by Ada County Assessor's office pool their address into one <a href="https://adacounty.id.gov/assessor/land-records/ada-county-assessor-data/" target="_blank">compiled set</a> to provide timely location information for Emergency 911 Response as well as a host of other government operations.

Digline provides underground utility location services for the State of Idaho. State law requires any underground utility to be located by its operators within 2 ft. of accuracy upon request. Digline receives the locate requests and notifies the locating agency of the request. There is a fee charged by Digline for each request. Also, each request takes staff time to research and respond, even if there are no utilities in proximity to the locate request. By automating the export and delivery of GIS information to Digline monthly, the City of Meridian was able to greatly reduce the number of requests they received. Now, when they do get a request, they know that they have buried assets within 50 ft of the request and that it's worth their time to head out to the site and mark their utilities.

### Documentation and Notifications
One of the frustrating things for some agencies is that it is difficult to know what is wrong when a script or other automation fails to do its intended job. It's even more frustrating when you didn't know it was broken. Through script comments and advanced logging and notification methods, automation scripts can give staff the same level of detail on the success or failure of a process as they were used to in desktop GIS Software. Better than that, they don't even need notification if it worked. That detail can just be put in the logs. However, when something *does* go wrong, I can send an email or submit a support ticket if that's an option. It's up to you who gets notified when and with the method of your choice.
