In 2017, a good friend asked me if I knew how to set up a website where anyone who wanted to ride all the trails in the foothills could submit their GPS file and have it mark off their progress. I couldn't have accomplished it all myself. But with the help of a web developer friend and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boisetrailpics/" target="_blank">great team</a>, we were able to create a local trail community event called the <a href="https://boisetrailschallenge.com/" target="_blank">Boise Trails Challenge</a> which has been a real joy to be a part of. Integrations with Strava and some SQL Server Geometry *magic* came together to host over 1,100 participants in 2020 giving it all they had to watch the trails turn green as they passed them off.
