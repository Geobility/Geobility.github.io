Multiple assets come in with each project. Asset management specialists were entering the same warranty information on hundreds of assets one at a time. They knew these assets were in GIS so **they had an idea**. I developed a tool that would allow them to view all the assets from a single project by searching for the project ID. They could simply select all or a subset of those and enter the warranty information one time and it would show for each asset in the City of Meridian's Asset Managment System. This project took less than a month to develope and easily **saves hundreds of hours** a year.
