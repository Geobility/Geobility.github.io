Each valve, manhole, mainline and hydrant comes with some sort of warranty. When multiple assets are installed at the same time, asset management specialists were entering the same warranty information on hundreds of assets *one at a time*. They knew these assets were in GIS so **they had an idea**. I developed a tool around that idea that would allow them to view all the assets from a single project by searching for the project ID. They could simply select all or a subset of those and enter the warranty information _once_ and it would show for each asset in the City of Meridian's Asset Managment System. This project took less than a month to develop and easily **saves hundreds of hours** per year.
