### Ada County Address Compilation
Addresses are added or changed daily. Thanks to automation, they are also compiled daily. The Cities of Meridian and Boise as well as others managed by Ada County Assessor's office pool their address into one <a href="https://adacounty.id.gov/assessor/land-records/ada-county-assessor-data/" target="_blank">compiled set</a> to provide timely location information for Emergency 911 Response as well as a host of other government operations.


### Digline Utility Location Export <img src="assets/img/portfolio/digline_logo.jpg" alt="Digline Logo" height="40" style="vertical-align:text-top"/>  
Digline provides underground utility location services for the State of Idaho. State law requires any underground utility to be located by its operators within 2 ft. of accuracy upon request. Digline receives the locate requests and notifies the locating agency of the request. There is a fee charged by Digline for each request. Also, each request takes staff time to research and respond, even if there are no utilities in proximity to the locate request. By automating the export and delivery of GIS information to Digline monthly, the City of Meridian was able to greatly reduce the number of requests they received. Now, when they do get a request, they know that they have buried assets within 50 ft of the request and that it's worth their time to head out to the site and mark their utilities.

### Ada County Assessor Information Import
Doug: this needs a rewrite! This is supposed to be a portfolio item, not a sales pitch about automation. One of the frustrating things for some agencies is that it is difficult to know what is wrong when a script or other automation fails to do its intended job. It's even more frustrating when you didn't know it was broken. Through script comments and advanced logging and notification methods, automation scripts can give staff the same level of detail on the success or failure of a process as they were used to in desktop GIS Software. Better than that, they don't even need notification if it worked. That detail can just be put in the logs. However, when something *does* go wrong, I can send an email or submit a support ticket if that's an option. It's up to you who gets notified when and with the method of your choice.

### Map Visualization of Third-Party Database Information
Some Database applications contain information that is not fully comprehended when viewed in charts and tables. When this information can be linked to location and viewed spatially, the data begins to speak to us more clearly. I've enabled these databases to speak to uses either through planned integration prior to implementation, or designing new workflows that have brought tabular data into real-world mapping applications.
