### Ada County Address Compilation
Addresses are added or changed daily. Thanks to automation, they are also compiled daily. The Cities of Meridian and Boise as well as others managed by Ada County Assessor's office pool their address into one <a href="https://adacounty.id.gov/assessor/land-records/ada-county-assessor-data/" target="_blank">compiled set</a> to provide timely location information for Emergency 911 Response as well as a host of other government operations.


### Digline Utility Location Export <img src="assets/img/portfolio/digline_logo.jpg" alt="Digline Logo" height="40" style="vertical-align:text-top"/>  
Digline provides underground utility location services for the State of Idaho. State law requires any underground utility to be located by its operators within 2 ft. of accuracy upon request. Digline receives the locate requests and notifies the locating agency of the request. There is a fee charged by Digline for each request. Also, each request takes staff time to research and respond, even if there are no utilities in proximity to the locate request. By automating the export and delivery of GIS information to Digline monthly, the City of Meridian was able to greatly reduce the number of requests they received. Now, when they do get a request, they know that they have buried assets within 50 ft of the request and that it's worth their time to head out to the site and mark their utilities.

### Python Scripting
With multiple Enterprise Geodatabase environments and workflows that depend on data being packaged for use in the field, much of the GIS work at the City of Meridian is done after-hours through automated Python scripts. Through enhanced error checking, many critical scripts send email alerts or create helpdesk tickets when something goes wrong. Detailed logging also shortens the troubleshooting time. These scripts ensure data flows execute consistently and on a predictable schedule.

### Microsoft SQL-Server ETL
Some Database applications contain information that is not fully comprehended when viewed in charts and tables. When this information can be linked to location and viewed spatially, the data begins to speak to us more clearly. SQL Views and Stored Procedures have enabled the City of Meridian's databases to speak to users through regular data extraction, transformation and loading into mapping databases and applications. These integrations enhance the ability to visualize and analyze all varieties of the City's operational information.
