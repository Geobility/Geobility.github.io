As a new utility billing system was being configured, the City of Meridian wanted to improve the visibility of their water usage and service locations. The first step was to ensure that all of the service locations were paired with valid addresses and the system was set up to validate all new addresses. In addition, the location of the meters were stored in GIS. Working with TruePoint Solutions to ensure that a GIS feature ID was tied to each service location enabled true GIS integration. This brought enhancements in geographic visualizations and analysis, efficiency in daily operations, higher accuracy in record-keeping:

- Real-time visualization of meter reading assets on a map for field operations
- Visualization of meter life cycles for replacement planning
- Enhanced accuracy and reduced cost of water modelling due to water usage geolocation.
- Addresses validated against GIS records on service point creation reduces time spent in the field locating assets
- Improved customer service with elimination of billing location discrepencies
