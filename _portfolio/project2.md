As a new utility billing system was implemented, integrations were completed on addresses, service locations and water meters. This brought enhancements in efficiency, accuracy and geographic analysis:

{:.list-inline}
- Real-time visualization of meter reading assets on a map for field operations
- Visualization of meter life cycles for replacement planning
- Enhanced accuracy and reduced cost of water modelling due to water usage no longer needing to be geolocated based on addresses.
- Addresses validated against GIS records on service point creation reduces time spent in the field locating assets
