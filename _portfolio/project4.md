Fleet tracking has become quite popular. Managers not only have a view of where their fleet and staff are for operational purposes, but they also have verification when complaints come in. Being able to review the recent history of a vehicles location not only protects an organization but also provides reassurance for those operating the vehicles when erroneous accusations and accidents occur. There are several Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) service providers out there offering expansive feature sets. For some agencies, all the bells and whistles get in the way of just having that one bell that would completely meet their need. Custom AVL solutions provided the specific functionality the City of Meridian required without the pricetag or complexity of the off-the-shelf options. Due to the focus on what was really needed, these systems were able to provide vehicle locations every 2 seconds for Police, Fire, Public Works and Building Inspections. History can be replayed for up to 2 months.
