Custom AVL solutions provided the specific functionality the City of Meridian required without the pricetag or complexity of the off-the-shelf options. Due to the focus on what was really needed, these systems were able to provide vehicle locations every 2 seconds for Police, Fire, Public Works and Building Inspections. History can be replayed for up to 2 months. A huge cost savings for small fleets and simple needs while still providing rapidly updating, real-time location information.
